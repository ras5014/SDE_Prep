-> Make notes about nextJS file structure with shadcn ui
-> Make notes about different ways we can use CSS in nextJS, Write about "clsx" library
-> Make notes about Next Image and how it does all optimizations under the hood for us
-> One benefit of using layouts in Next.js is that on navigation, only the page components update while the layout won't re-render. This is called partial rendering
-> Use NextJS Tutorial Images in the notes
-> Make notes on next Link component
    - To improve the navigation experience, Next.js automatically code splits your application by route segments. This is different from a traditional React SPA, where the browser loads all your application code on the initial page load.
    - Splitting code by routes means that pages become isolated. If a certain page throws an error, the rest of the application will still work. This is also less code for the browser to parse, which makes your application faster.
    - Furthermore, in production, whenever <Link> components appear in the browser's viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the linked route in the background. By the time the user clicks the link, 
      the code for the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and this is what makes the page transition near-instant!

-> Pattern: Showing active links
            A common UI pattern is to show an active link to indicate to the user what page they are currently on. To do this, you need to get the user's current path from the URL. 
            Next.js provides a hook called usePathname() that you can use to check the path and implement this pattern.
